# College Canteen Website

Hello from Kazakhstan! 🇰🇿 
This is my **first website**, created in just a couple of days.

 The project is a canteen website where you can:
- View a list of available dishes,
- Filter dishes by category,
- Find out information about allergens,
- Place an order using a simple form.

 The design is simple yet functional. Everything was created from scratch by hand, using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and a little **JavaScript**.
